This README file contains a description of what each script in the shell-variable_expansions project does:

**0-alias**  :  Creates an alias. [Name: ls, Value: rm \*] 

**1-hello_you**  :  Prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user

**2-path**  :  Adds /action to the PATH. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program

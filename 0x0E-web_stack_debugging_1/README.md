> This repository contains the tasks for `Web stack debugging #1` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Learning Objectives

* Debugging usually takes a big chunk of a software engineer’s time. The art of debugging is tough and it takes years, even decades to master, and that is why seasoned software engineers are the best at it… experience. They have seen lots of broken code, buggy systems, weird edge cases and race conditions.

### Tasks

#### Task: 0-nginx_likes_port_80
Using your debugging skills, find out what’s keeping your Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.
* Nginx must be running, and listening on port 80 of all the server’s active IPv4 IPs
* Write a Bash script that configures a server to the above requirements

#### Task: 
Using what you did for task #0, make your fix short and sweet.
* Bash script must be 5 lines long or less
* There must be a new line at the end of the file
* You must respect usual Bash script requirements
* You cannot use `;`
* You cannot use `&&`
* You cannot use `wget`

## 0x17. Web stack debugging #3

> This repository contains the tasks for `Web stack debugging #3` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Learning Objectives

* When debugging, sometimes logs are not enough. Either because the software is breaking in a way that was not expected and the error is not being logged, or because logs are not providing enough information. In this case, you will need to go down the stack.

* Wordpress is a very popular tool, it allows you to run blogs, portfolios, e-commerce and company websitesâ€¦ It actually powers 26% of the web. Wordpress is usually run on LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP), which is a very widely used set of tools. 


### Tasks

#### Task: 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
* Using `strace`, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash).

## 0x15. API

> This repository contains the tasks for `API` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Learning Objectives

    * What Bash scripting should not be used for?
    * What is an API?
    * What is a REST API?
    * What are microservices?
    * What is the CSV format?
    * What is the JSON format?
    * Pythonic Package and module name style
    * Pythonic Class name style
    * Pythonic Variable name style
    * Pythonic Function name style
    * Pythonic Constant name style
    * Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

* An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that defines how two software programs should interact with each other. It specifies how software components should communicate and exchange data.
* REST (Representational State Transfer) is a type of API that uses HTTP requests to GET, POST, PUT, DELETE data. It is a standard for creating web-based APIs and is based on the principles of HTTP and the architecture of the World Wide Web.
* Microservices are a software architecture pattern where a large, complex application is broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other to perform specific tasks. Each microservice is designed to be highly modular, scalable, and loosely coupled, making it easy to develop, deploy, and maintain.


### Tasks

#### Task: 0-gather_data_from_an_API.py
* Write a Python script that, using this [REST API](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/7cr7aLYdaWAZWBKrBKS12A), for a given employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.

#### Task: 1-export_to_CSV.py
* Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the CSV format.

#### Task: 2-export_to_JSON.py
* Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.

#### Task: 3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py
* Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.
